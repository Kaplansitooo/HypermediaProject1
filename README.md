# HypermediaProject1
This project took me a while to define the style and figure out what I wanted to do. At first, I thought about creating a simple and formal résumé, but I wasn’t fully satisfied with the idea. Then I started thinking about the vibe I wanted it to have and decided to implement some kind of balloons or buttons. The first design featured simple rounded rectangles in different colors, which was closer to what I envisioned but still didn’t look quite right. Finally, I came up with the idea of placing my photo in the center in profile mode.

The target audience for this résumé includes people who might hire me and appreciate originality and out-of-the-ordinary designs. I hope the résumé stands out to those individuals and that they value its uniqueness compared to a standard résumé.

The layout features rounded rectangles distributed around the central photo. I aimed to place the most important information in the most visible positions to make the résumé visually appealing.
